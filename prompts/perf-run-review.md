**Files to include:**

- @console-output.md
- @2025-07-15T18-52-23-625Z-report.json [מעודכן]
- @2025-07-15T18-52-23-625Z-report.csv [מעודכן]
- @ticketFlow-perf.js

**Instructions:**

1. Parse and present the timeline step-by-step for the ticket page (exclude login).

2. Identify any especially slow or suspicious steps (mark durations, slow XHR, slow assets, etc).

3. Suggest next profiling or debug targets to further isolate slowness.

4. If the timeline is missing any important step or perf value, tell me *exactly* what to add or instrument in my perf script.
